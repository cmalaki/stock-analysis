# stock-analysis

## Project Overview

  The purpose of this project was to analyze an entire dataset. This required us to refoctor the module solution code in order to loop through all of the data just one time. Refactoring is important because it helps clean up the code and make it more efficient. Our initial code would have taken a longer time to complete to get the same information.
  The data presented to analyze comprised of two charts from "2017" and "2018" with stock information on 12 different tickers. The aim was to expand our dataset to incldue the entire stock market over this span, which would take longer using our original code. The information we wanted to gather was the ticker name, total daily volume, and return percentage.

## Results

  To loop through the data one time and collect all of the needed information, I initially copied the code over to activate the worksheet. I then created output arrays as well as loops for tickers, after creating a ticker index and setting it equal to zero. I followed the steps given. This resulted in a much shorter run time of the analysis for all stocks. What took approximately one second in time, now takes about .5 seconds to run. This is much more efficient and time saving than the initial mechanism. I'm sure there are things I could go and edit further to shorten this time even more. 

## Summary

Refactoring code is useful in shortening and organizing written code. This can lead to quicker programming and debugging, as well as running and analyzing the data, the refactored code is more efficient and makes the information easier to digest. This creates better quality code that is more readable and easier to modify. Refactoring code cannot always be done depending on budget and time alotted for a project. Viewers may also struggle to understand the interworkings of the code, not having to sift through as much data. All in all, refactoring is a great tool to use when maintaining code.
